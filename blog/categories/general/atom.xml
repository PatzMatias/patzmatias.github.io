    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi! To start-off with this blog let me introduce myself.</p>

<p>I am Patrick Arcangel Matias. I’m 24 years old and I live in Cabanatuan City. I studied at Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology and I am now a graduate of Bachelor of Science In information Technology, with System Analysis and Design as my major. I am currently training for web development here at Favorite Medium with my colleagues from school.</p>

<p>The reason I got into Information Technology was because of gaming. But as I go on with my studies it changed. I got interested in programming, multimedia, and web development. In my last year at school we’ve decided to make a research about making a museum website.  During the research I’m not really in the state where I can deliver the best website I can make because I still lack knowledge regarding designing and some web programming coding. But that was the essence of the research, to gain knowledge about things you’ve never known before. I’ve done research about JavaScript and HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) Document Type Standards, but I mostly studied CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) that time because it offers more properties and options for designing and layout than HTML alone. At the end, I was able to create a static website with a (pretty much) responsive design. However, I only used a premade or a readily available framework of the design or what is also called the Bootstrap. It is the research that got me interested to web development.</p>

<p>We’ve also studied PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) with MySQL integration during the last semester of our school year. PHP has characteristics, similar on some software programming language except only that it needs a server and a browser to run. I found it awesome so I tried to study more than what our professor has taught us. To enhance my knowledge on PHP I decided to renovate my museum website from a static website to a dynamic website. The outcome turned out to be better than my first attempt, I was really pleased, and it got me motivated to learn more.</p>

<p>During my school years I’ve tried and studied many things so I can become a well-rounded IT Professional. I pursued graphics designing, photo-editing, audio mixing, video processing and other things that caught my interest. I’ve been exploring topics about the fields of the IT Industry to know where I would fit in and I think web development is the answer. I’m really looking forward to learning many things during this training, and I believe that with the guidance of our seniors here at Favorite Medium, they can bring the best out me and my potential as a web developer.</p>

<p>Web development for me is an art. The colors and the shapes, the photographs we see in a frame, web development puts them all together to create a wonderful    work of art and modern technology, and to convey a message in the best medium of information today.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! That is all for now.</p>
